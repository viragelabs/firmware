Firmware source code (V3.2) for [Virage Laboratories](https://www.viragelabs.com/products) WiFi-enabled devices, including:

- VirageSwitch
- VirageDimmer
- ViragePlug
- VirageBridge

These are based on [Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota), but have been modified and customized to control specific Virage Laboratories devices including a simplified UI,
enhanced MQTT capabilities, hard-coding of configuration (to survive a factory reset) and removal of unnecessary settings, and removal of unnecessary code to bring compiled
size below 500KB.

As this code has been optimized for specific hardware products, use at your own risk on other hardware.

Thanks to [Theo Arends](https://github.com/arendst) and for his great work in developing Tasmota!
